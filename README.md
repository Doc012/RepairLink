# RepairLink - Service Booking Platform

**RepairLink** is a full-stack web application that connects customers with local service providers. Customers can book services, manage bookings, and leave feedback. Service providers can register, list their services, and manage their bookings.

This project is being developed iteratively with versioned releases â€” each version introducing major upgrades and new features that reflect real-world development practices.
